# BACI: BAsic Commandline Interface

This project is a personal exercise in creating a basic shell imitation that connects to the kernel/OS, for unix systems. Considerable amount of simplifying assumptions are currently done for this implementations, such as all the current commands being implementated by being pre compilied into the executable, and the lack of forking of proccess'.
